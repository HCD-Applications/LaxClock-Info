### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
Take control of every moment on the field with **LaxClock**, the all-in-one lacrosse game management app. Whether you’re a coach, official, or scorekeeper, LaxClock makes it easy to track game time, shot clock, score, penalties, timeouts, and breaks — all from one clean, intuitive screen.

## Features

### Time & Scorekeeping Made Simple
- Track game time, shot clock, team score, and timeouts remaining in real time.
- Adjust the game clock on the fly — updates automatically apply to the shot clock and penalties.
- Use built-in timers for timeouts, halftime, and period breaks.
- Track alternating possession with a single tap.

### Smart Penalty Management
- Add player penalties individually and in order — LaxClock automatically combines multiple penalties for the same player, with non-releasable time served first.
- When a team exceeds three penalties, additional penalties are auto-stacked until space is available.
- Releasable penalties automatically clear when the opposing team scores.
- Optional time-and-a-half penalty mode for running-time game formats.

### Custom Game Formats
Create and save your preferred game setup for any level of play. Customize:
- Period type (halves or quarters)
- Period, overtime, and break lengths
- Halftime duration
- Timeouts per half and timeout length
- Shot clock reset times
- Default penalty durations
