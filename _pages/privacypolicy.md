# Privacy Policy for LaxClock

_Last updated: October 28, 2025_

LaxClock (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application **LaxClock** (the “App”).



## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

LaxClock does **not** require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information.  
We do **not** collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email, phone number, or location).



## 2. Third-Party Services We Use

While LaxClock itself does not collect personal data, the App uses third-party services for advertising, analytics, and crash reporting. These services may collect limited information automatically (such as device type, usage data, or advertising identifiers) to perform their respective functions.

### Google AdMob
- **Purpose:** Displays in-app interstitial advertisements.
- **Provider:** Google LLC
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Firebase Analytics
- **Purpose:** Measures app usage, engagement, and user activity to help improve the experience.
- **Provider:** Google LLC
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

### Firebase Crashlytics
- **Purpose:** Reports app crashes and errors that occur in production.
    - Crashlytics may log user actions taken prior to a crash to help developers diagnose the issue.
- **Provider:** Google LLC
- **Privacy Policy:** [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)


## 3. Advertising and Analytics

LaxClock displays advertisements using Google AdMob, which may use device identifiers or cookies to deliver relevant ads and track ad performance.  
You can learn more about how Google uses information from apps and manage your ad preferences here:  
[https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

Analytics data from Firebase helps us understand how the app is used so we can make improvements.  
All such data is collected in aggregate and does not personally identify users.


## 4. User Consent

By using LaxClock, you consent to the use of third-party services as described in this Privacy Policy.  
Users in certain regions (such as the European Economic Area) may see a consent prompt when the app first launches, giving them the option to manage or withdraw consent for analytics and advertising.


## 5. Your Privacy Rights (GDPR / CCPA Compliance)

If you are located in a region with privacy laws such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** or the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, you have certain rights regarding your data:

- The right to know what data is collected and for what purpose.
- The right to access, correct, or request deletion of personal data (if any is held by third parties).
- The right to opt out of data sharing for advertising or analytics purposes.

Because LaxClock does not collect or store user data directly, requests related to data collected by third-party services (Google, Firebase) should be directed to those providers.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

LaxClock is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years old.  
If you believe that your child has shared information through third-party services used by this app, please contact those providers directly.


## 7. Data Security

LaxClock does not store any personal or usage data on our own servers.  
All data collected by third-party services is handled securely in accordance with their respective privacy policies.


## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect new features, regulatory changes, or improvements.  
Any updates will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the app after updates means you accept the revised policy.
